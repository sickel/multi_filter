name=Multifilter
qgisMinimumVersion=3.0
description=Filter multiple layers
version=0.5
author=Morten Sickel
email=morten@sickel.net

about=Set the same filter on mulitple selected layers in a project
    <b>Usage</b>
    Select the layers to be filtered in the dropdown list and press the + button. Type in a filter expression in the text box and press "Filter". The same filter will be set on all layers, any existing filter will be removed.
    
    Select a layer and press the '-' button to remove the layer from the list, this will not change the filter status for the layer.
    
    Press 'Clear' to remove the filter on all listed layers, this will leave the layers unfiltered and not restore any earlier filter.
    
    The plugin is not checking the filter in any way. At least for a layer from Postgis, there will be an error message if a wrong field name is given, for most other types of layers, it will fail quietly and not return any data. Tip: Set the filter on one of the layers using the normal filtering dialog and copy the string.
    
    <b>Plans</b>
    <ul>
    <li>See if the filter creation dialog can be reused</li>
    <li>Copy out a filter from one of the layers</li>
    <li>Store layers and filter in the project.</li>
    <li>Mark layers where the filter fails</li>
    <li>Mark layers with no items after filtering</li>
    </ul>
